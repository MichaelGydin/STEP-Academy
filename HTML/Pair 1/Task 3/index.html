    <h2><center>What is HTML?</center></h2>
    <p><center><b>Hypertext Markup Language (<u>HTML</u>)</b> is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications.</p>
    <p>Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web 
        page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.</p>
    <p><u>HTML</u> elements are the building blocks of <u>HTML</u> pages. With <u>HTML</u> constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded 
        into the rendered page. <u>HTML</u> provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, 
        links, quotes and other items. <u>HTML</u> elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <i>(img)</i> and <i>(input)</i> directly 
        introduce content into the page. Other tags such as <i>(p)</i> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. 
        Browsers do not display the <u>HTML</u> tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</center></p>

    <h2><center>Markup</center></h2>
    <p><center>HTML markup consists of several key components, including those called tags (and their attributes), character-based data types, character references and 
        entity references. HTML tags most commonly come in pairs like <h1> and </h1>, although some represent empty elements and so are unpaired, for example (img). The 
        first tag in such a pair is the start tag, and the second is the end tag (they are also called opening tags and closing tags).</center></p>
    <p><center>Another important component is the HTML document type declaration, which triggers standards mode rendering.</center></p>
